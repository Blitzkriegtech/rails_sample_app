# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

# Create a main sample user.
User.create!(name: "Examle User",
             email: "example@railstutorial.org",
             password: "foobar12",
             password_confirmation: "foobar12",
             admin: true,
             activated: true,
             activated_at: Time.zone.now)

# Generate a bunch of additional users.
99.times do |n|
  name = Faker::Name.name
  email = "example-#{n+1}@railstutorial.org"
  password = "password12"
  User.create!(name: name,
               email: email,
               password: password,
               password_confirmation: password,
               activated: true,
               activated_at: Time.zone.now)
